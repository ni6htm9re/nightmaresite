<h2>tiny QNA i guess</h2>
<p>What code editor do i use: For batch, i use notepad++, which by the way, if you thought it was paid, it's actually not! get it, it's really good for code editing sometimes, i use vscode for html css and others. its better then np++ but i only use it some projects, because i hate the insert key. </p>
<p>How did you get started with batch: i kinda just found it existed and started to like it</p>
